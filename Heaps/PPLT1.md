### Q1.
## Compilation Process
1. Faster Execution Speed.
2. Tougher to Debug.
3. Since the entire code is available to the machine, type checking is easy.

## Interpretive Process
1. Cons are all the pros of Compilation.
2. Portability, independent of machines, since Interpreter will handle it for you.
3. Easy Debugging.
4. Issue: same code may be compiled again and again, if it keeps repeating. 

### Q2.
Java is more stable, more reliable, lesser cost (See SS).

### Q3.
1. Easier to perform the operation, however lesser readable for someone else.

### Q4.
1. C allows you to manage your own memory, however this comes at the cost of being able to cause Segmentation Faults. Java can prevent this.

### Q5.
1. Highly Orthogonal but Readability and Writability isn't there.
